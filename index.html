        <h2>Biograph</h2>
        <p>I am an airline pilot and As an airline pilot, l fly passengers or cargo on long or short-haul flights
            for leisure, business or commercial purposes. The aircraft is typically operated by two pilots; one will be the captain who is the pilot in command, while the other will be the supporting first officer. Pilots usually take turns to fly the plane to avoid fatigue, with one operating the controls, while the other speaks to air traffic control and completes the paperwork.
